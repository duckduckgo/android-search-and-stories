We are excited to engage the community in the development of our [apps](https://duckduckgo.com/app)! While development on this project is currently on hold, we are working on a new project at https://github.com/duckduckgo/android which we will open up to contributions soon. Stay tuned!

If you are trying to contribute in other ways, that happens over at [DuckDuckHack](http://duckduckhack.com) or on [GitHub](http://github.com/duckduckgo).

The Android app is available via Google Play here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&hl=en_GB
